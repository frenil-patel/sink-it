Sink‚ÄëIt (CodeSync) ‚Äî Semantic Merging for TypeScript

Merge by meaning, not by lines. Sink‚ÄëIt performs AST‚Äëaware 3‚Äëway merges for TypeScript, auto‚Äëreconciling common ‚Äúboth edited this file‚Äù scenarios (e.g., a parameter rename on one branch + a punctuation/text tweak on the other) and hoisting/de‚Äëduping imports ‚Äî producing clean code with fewer conflicts.

‚∏ª

‚ú® Why

Traditional Git merges are text‚Äëbased. They flag conflicts even when two edits are semantically compatible. That wastes time and breaks developer flow. Sink‚ÄëIt parses code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and composes changes at the code‚Äëstructure level ‚Äî safely auto‚Äëmerging the easy/medium cases and only raising conflicts when unsure.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ What it does (MVP)
	‚Ä¢	AST‚Äëbased 3‚Äëway merge for TypeScript (.ts/.tsx)
	‚Ä¢	Precise splicing of changed top‚Äëlevel units (functions/classes/vars)
	‚Ä¢	Rename‚Äëaware merges for simple function parameter renames
	‚Ä¢	Import union: de‚Äëdupes and hoists imports to the top of the file
	‚Ä¢	Conservative policy: when ambiguous, emits a clear conflict (no risky guesses)
	‚Ä¢	Git‚Äëaware CLI: reads refs from your repo and writes merged results to ./.codesync/

Output is written to .codesync/ so your working tree remains untouched.

üöÄ Quick demo (copy‚Äëpaste)

# 1) Create a tiny TS repo with two branches
mkdir -p demo-ts && cd demo-ts && git init && mkdir -p src
cat > src/user.ts <<'EOF'
export function updateUser(name: string) {
  return "Hello " + name;
}
EOF
git add . && git commit -m "base"

git checkout -b feature/a
cat > src/user.ts <<'EOF'
import { log } from "./util";
export function updateUser(userName: string) {
  return "Hello " + userName;
}
EOF
echo 'export const log = (..._args:any[])=>{}' > src/util.ts
git add . && git commit -m "A: rename + import"

git checkout -b feature/b main
cat > src/user.ts <<'EOF'
export function updateUser(name: string) {
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}
EOF
git add . && git commit -m "B: punctuation"

# 2) From the Sink‚ÄëIt Rust project folder (the one with Cargo.toml for core)
cd ../core
cargo run --bin sinkit -- ../demo-ts feature/a feature/b

# 3) Inspect result
sed -n '1,160p' .codesync/src__user.ts

Expected output:

import { log } from "./util";

export function updateUser(userName: string) {
  return "Hello, " + userName + "!";
}

üß© How it works (architecture)
	1.	Parse (tree‚Äësitter) ‚Üí Build a minimal top‚Äëlevel AST for TS/TSX.
	2.	Diff Base‚ÜíA and Base‚ÜíB at the unit level (function/class/import/var).
	3.	Compose the edit scripts:
	‚Ä¢	Splice accepted updates by byte range from the Base AST
	‚Ä¢	Reconcile param renames (simple heuristic) to combine otherwise conflicting edits
	‚Ä¢	Union imports and place them at the top (de‚Äëduped)
	4.	Conservative fallback: if both branches change the same unit incompatibly ‚Üí emit a conflict reason.

Key crates: tree-sitter, tree-sitter-typescript, serde, anyhow.

üõ†Ô∏è Install / Build

Requirements: Rust (via rustup) and git.

# in the repo root
cargo build

If cargo isn‚Äôt found, run: . "$HOME/.cargo/env" then cargo --version.

‚∏ª

üß™ CLI usage

sinkit <repo_path> <A_ref> <B_ref>

Examples:

# run via cargo
cargo run --bin sinkit -- ~/code/my-ts-repo feature/a feature/b

# after building
./target/debug/sinkit ~/code/my-ts-repo feature/a feature/b

Results are written to ./.codesync/ (relative to the current working directory). Files keep path semantics using __ in place of / (e.g., src__user.ts).

‚∏ª

‚ö†Ô∏è Current scope & limitations
	‚Ä¢	Top‚Äëlevel units only (functions/classes/imports/var decls)
	‚Ä¢	Rename‚Äëaware merge only for first function parameter; other signature/inside‚Äëbody edits may still conflict
	‚Ä¢	Import union is line‚Äëlevel (does not yet coalesce {a} + {b} into {a, b})
	‚Ä¢	No cross‚Äëfile refactor detection (no TS symbol graph yet)
	‚Ä¢	TSX is parsed; name extraction for default exports/HOCs may be conservative

Design is intentionally conservative: when unsure, emit a conflict instead of risking broken code.

‚∏ª

üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
	‚Ä¢	Import specifier coalescing (import {a} + import {b} ‚Üí import {a, b})
	‚Ä¢	Statement‚Äëlevel tree diff (GumTree‚Äëstyle) to reconcile edits inside function bodies
	‚Ä¢	TypeScript compiler integration (ts‚Äëmorph) for robust rename detection across files
	‚Ä¢	Method‚Äëlevel splicing inside classes
	‚Ä¢	VS Code extension & GitHub Action wrappers
	‚Ä¢	Multi‚Äëlanguage support (add parsers: Go/Java/Python)

üôã FAQ

Does this replace Git? No. It‚Äôs a smarter merge layer you can run before/after a normal merge.

Will it solve all conflicts? No. It automates safe, common cases and surfaces the rest.

Does it change my working tree? No ‚Äî results go to .codesync/.
